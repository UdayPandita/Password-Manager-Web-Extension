# LPH Password Manager - Fixed Issues

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Popup Width (Half-Screen Issue)
**Problem:** The popup was too narrow and looked cramped as shown in your screenshot.

**Solution:** 
- Set `min-width: 380px` on the popup body
- Set `min-width: 340px` on password inputs
- This gives a proper, readable width for the extension popup

### 2. Logo Integration
**Problem:** Extension had no logo/icon.

**Solution:**
- Updated `manifest.json` to reference `icons/logo.png` for all icon sizes (16, 32, 48, 128)
- Added both extension-wide icons and action (toolbar) icons
- The Los Pollos Hermanos logo you attached will be used automatically

## 📋 Next Steps - ADD YOUR LOGO

**You need to save the logo file manually:**

1. Take the "Los Pollos Hermanos" image you attached (second attachment)
2. Save it as: `/Users/udaypandita/Desktop/USS Project/LPH/extension/icons/logo.png`
3. Go to Chrome: `chrome://extensions`
4. Find "LPH Password Manager" and click the reload icon ↻

That's it! Your logo will appear in:
- Chrome toolbar (extension icon)
- Extension manager page
- Anywhere Chrome shows extension icons

## 📁 Files Changed

- ✏️ `popup.html` - Fixed width from auto to 380px minimum
- ✏️ `manifest.json` - Added icons paths pointing to logo.png
- ✏️ `README.md` - Updated with clear logo setup instructions
- ➕ `icons/SETUP_LOGO.md` - Step-by-step logo setup guide

## 🧪 Test After Adding Logo

1. Save logo to `icons/logo.png`
2. Reload extension
3. Check toolbar icon shows Los Pollos Hermanos logo
4. Open popup - should be wider and readable
5. Test unlock/lock functionality

## 💡 Why Chrome Needs You to Save the File

I can't directly write image files from attachments, so you need to:
- Drag and drop the logo image to the `icons/` folder, OR
- Right-click → Save As → name it `logo.png`

Once you do, Chrome will immediately pick it up when you reload the extension!
